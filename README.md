# Image-Classifier

In this session, I will run Tensorflow on a single machine and will train a simple classifier to classify images of flowers.
We will be using transfer learning which means we start with a model that has been trained on similar problem. Transfer learning can be done in shorter order as compared to deep learning from scratch.

A model trained on the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge dataset is being used. 


###Step 1: Install Tensorflow
```
> pip install --upgrade "tensorflow==1.7.*"
```
